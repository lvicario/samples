        <div class="two-column">
        	<p>Business as usual no longer exists, it has become the exception. Economic and social changes, technology advances, environmental challenges and market demands all require an agile organization that can respond quickly and competently in order to remain successful.</p>
            <p>We are constantly adapting to meet tomorrow’s challenges, increasing scale, reach and expertise to service our clients wherever they are. We provide advanced IT solutions and outsourcing services with a global reach. The alliance of Atos Origin and Siemens IT Solutions that was completed on July 1st 2011 is a major step in our strategy to extend our global reach and complement our portfolio and market expertise. Together we progress as Atos, a strong combination that will drive growth and greatly enhance the services we provide.</p>
            <p>The power of this partnership allows us to pursue our vision for the future. That is, to accelerate progress by uniting people, business and technology.</p>
            <p>One of such example is our involvement in the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The best athletes, tens of thousands of dedicated volunteers, millions of visitors, billions of viewers, complex logistics and critical security make the Olympic Games more than just a sporting event. It’s the world’s largest and none of it would be possible without bringing together people, business and technology.</p>
            <p>As the Worldwide IT Partner, we lead the technology efforts for the staging of the Olympic Games. We manage and intergrate the contributions of all technology partners and suppliers to deliver seamless and secure technology operations and services, doing so at each Games on time and within budget.</p>
            <p>For us, the Olympic Games is the perfect example of human achievement, powered by technology. And, as technologists that have been making it all possible for the last two decades, we’re thrilled to be part of it.</p>
